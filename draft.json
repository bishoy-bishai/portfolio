  "script": "Hey everyone! You know, when I first dove into React, it felt like learning to ride a bike backwards. There were so many \"aha!\" moments that came *after* I'd already built something completely wrong. One that sticks with me is my early relationship with `useEffect`. I remember building a dashboard, furiously trying to fetch data and update state, only to find myself in an infinite loop. It was a classic case of not understanding dependency arrays, and I\u2019d just slap `[]` on everything, hoping for the best.\n\nThe breakthrough came when I realized `useEffect` wasn't just a `componentDidMount` replacement; it was about synchronizing side effects with your component's lifecycle based on *dependencies*. Once I truly grasped that, and stopped thinking of props as direct mutable state, my code started to breathe. It\u2019s funny how a simple concept can feel so complex until you hit that inflection point. My big takeaway? Don't just copy-paste hooks; really dig into *why* they work the way they do. Understanding React's mental model is half the battle won.",

  "blog": "# The React Rabbit Holes I Fell Into (So You Don't Have To)\n\nWhen I first started with React, fresh off the jQuery train, it felt like entering a different dimension. Everything was components, state, props, and this mysterious \"virtual DOM.\" It promised a declarative paradise, but my early code often looked more like a spaghetti monster trying to escape a component tree. I\u2019ve found that many of the initial struggles aren't necessarily about complex algorithms, but about fundamentally misunderstanding how React *thinks*.\n\nI remember one early project, a simple data table with filtering and sorting. My instinct, coming from imperative programming, was to mutate data directly or have components reach up and directly manipulate their parents. This, as you can imagine, led to a cascade of unpredictable updates and state bugs that were a nightmare to debug. It was a painful, yet invaluable, introduction to the \"React Way.\"\n\nHere's the thing: React has a specific mental model. When you fight it, you lose. When you embrace it, magic happens. My goal here isn't to just list common mistakes, but to share the *aha!* moments I had, and the lessons learned from real-world projects, hoping to fast-track your journey past those early roadblocks.\n\n### 1. Treating Props Like Local State (and then Wondering Why Nothing Updates)\n\nThis is a classic. You receive a prop, say `initialValue`, and you want to modify it within your component. So, you might do something like this:\n\n```typescript\n// \u274c Don't do this!\nfunction MyInput({ initialValue }: { initialValue: string }) {\n  const value = initialValue; // Assigning prop to a local variable\n  // ... then trying to change 'value' directly\n  // This 'value' won't re-render when initialValue changes from parent\n  return <input value={value} onChange={() => { /* mutate value? */ }} />;\n}\n```\n\nThe issue? Props are immutable, and React components re-render when their state or props change. If `initialValue` changes, `value` here is just a local variable copy *from the initial render*. It doesn't update.\n\n**The Fix: Use `useState` for internal, mutable state.**\n\nIf a prop is truly just an initial value that your component manages internally, bring it into state:\n\n```typescript\nfunction MyInput({ initialValue }: { initialValue: string }) {\n  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(initialValue);\n\n  // If the parent can change initialValue, you might need to sync it.\n  // This is a common pattern for \"controlled\" vs \"uncontrolled\" components.\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    setValue(initialValue);\n  }, [initialValue]); // Re-sync state when initialValue prop changes\n\n  return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />;\n}\n```\n\n**Insight:** `useState` creates a persistent, reactive piece of data. Props are *inputs* to your component. Understanding this distinction is fundamental to React's data flow.\n\n### 2. The `useEffect` Abyss: Infinite Loops and Missing Dependencies\n\nAh, `useEffect`. It's incredibly powerful but also a source of endless confusion. My early `useEffect` code often looked something like this:\n\n```typescript\n// \u274c Potential infinite loop!\nfunction DataFetcher({ id }: { id: string }) {\n  const [data, setData] = React.useState(null);\n\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    // This effect runs on every render if no dependency array is provided\n    // If setData causes a re-render, and this effect runs again,\n    // you're in an infinite loop.\n    fetch(`/api/data/${id}`).then(res => res.json()).then(setData);\n  }); // <-- No dependency array!\n  \n  return <div>{data ? JSON.stringify(data) : 'Loading...'}</div>;\n}\n```\n\nAnd then, once I learned about dependency arrays, I'd often misuse them:\n\n```typescript\n// \u274c Missing dependency!\nfunction DataFetcher({ id, authToken }: { id: string; authToken: string }) {\n  const [data, setData] = React.useState(null);\n\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    // This effect only runs once on mount due to empty array.\n    // If 'id' or 'authToken' changes, the fetch request uses stale values.\n    fetch(`/api/data/${id}`, { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}` } })\n      .then(res => res.json())\n      .then(setData);\n  }, []); // <-- Empty array, but depends on `id` and `authToken`!\n  \n  return <div>{data ? JSON.stringify(data) : 'Loading...'}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n**The Fix: Always specify *all* external values your effect depends on.**\n\nReact's linter (ESLint with `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`) is your best friend here.\n\n```typescript\nfunction DataFetcher({ id, authToken }: { id: string; authToken: string }) {\n  const [data, setData] = React.useState(null);\n  const [error, setError] = React.useState<string | null>(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = React.useState(true);\n\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    let isMounted = true; // Cleanup flag to prevent state updates on unmounted component\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      setLoading(true);\n      setError(null);\n      try {\n        const response = await fetch(`/api/data/${id}`, {\n          headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}` },\n        });\n        if (!response.ok) {\n          throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);\n        }\n        const result = await response.json();\n        if (isMounted) {\n          setData(result);\n        }\n      } catch (e: any) {\n        if (isMounted) {\n          setError(e.message);\n        }\n      } finally {\n        if (isMounted) {\n          setLoading(false);\n        }\n      }\n    };\n\n    fetchData();\n\n    return () => {\n      isMounted = false; // Cleanup: Mark component as unmounted\n    };\n  }, [id, authToken]); // Dependencies: Effect re-runs if 'id' or 'authToken' changes\n\n  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;\n  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;\n  return <div>{data ? JSON.stringify(data) : 'No data'}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n**Insight:** `useEffect` fires after every render where its dependencies have changed. If a dependency is missing, your effect might use stale data or simply not re-run when it should. If you include too many (especially objects or functions defined inline that change on every render), it might run too often. Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` for functions and objects that are themselves dependencies to stabilize them.\n\n### 3. Prop Drilling: The Long and Winding Road\n\nYou start with a simple parent-child relationship. Then the child needs something from the grandparent. Then the great-grandchild needs it. Soon, you're passing props through layers of components that don't even use those props themselves. This is \"prop drilling.\"\n\n```typescript\n// \u274c Prop Drilling example\nfunction App() {\n  const user = { name: \"Alice\", theme: \"dark\" };\n  return <Toolbar user={user} />;\n}\n\nfunction Toolbar({ user }: { user: { name: string; theme: string } }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <UserInfo user={user} />\n      <ThemeSwitcher theme={user.theme} /> {/* Toolbar doesn't directly use theme, just passes it */}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction UserInfo({ user }: { user: { name: string; theme: string } }) {\n  return <span>Welcome, {user.name}</span>;\n}\n\nfunction ThemeSwitcher({ theme }: { theme: string }) {\n  return <button>Switch to {theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark'} mode</button>;\n}\n```\n\nIn a small example, it's not terrible. In a real-world app with dozens of components, it becomes a maintenance nightmare.\n\n**The Fix: Context API or State Management Libraries.**\n\nFor less frequently updated global data, the React Context API is perfect. For more complex, frequently updated global state, or when you need more robust tools for debugging and asynchronous actions, libraries like Redux, Zustand, or Jotai shine.\n\nUsing Context:\n\n```typescript\ninterface UserContextType {\n  name: string;\n  theme: string;\n  // Potentially add functions to update theme etc.\n}\n\nconst UserContext = React.createContext<UserContextType | undefined>(undefined);\n\nfunction App() {\n  const user: UserContextType = { name: \"Alice\", theme: \"dark\" };\n  return (\n    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>\n      <Toolbar />\n    </UserContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Toolbar() {\n  // Toolbar no longer needs to receive 'user' as a prop\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <UserInfo />\n      <ThemeSwitcher />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction UserInfo() {\n  const user = React.useContext(UserContext);\n  if (!user) return null; // Or throw an error if context is expected\n  return <span>Welcome, {user.name}</span>;\n}\n\nfunction ThemeSwitcher() {\n  const user = React.useContext(UserContext);\n  if (!user) return null;\n  return <button>Switch to {user.theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark'} mode</button>;\n}\n```\n\n**Insight:** Context is great for \"theme\" or \"authenticated user\" type data that many components might need. Don't overuse it for *all* state, as it can make components less reusable and re-renders can be harder to optimize if the context value changes frequently.\n\n### 4. Forgetting `key` Props When Rendering Lists\n\nThis one is subtle but can cause weird bugs, performance issues, and even destroy component state.\n\n```typescript\n// \u274c Don't use index as key if items can change order or be added/removed!\nfunction ItemList({ items }: { items: string[] }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map((item, index) => (\n        <li key={index}>{item}</li> // Problematic if `items` array changes order\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIf the order of `items` changes, or an item is inserted in the middle, React uses the `index` as the `key` to identify which specific `<li>` corresponds to which data item. If the item at `index 0` was \"Apple\" and now it's \"Banana\" (because \"Orange\" was added at `index 0`), React will simply *update* the existing `<li>` component at `index 0` from \"Apple\" to \"Banana\" instead of re-ordering the actual `<li>` elements. This might seem fine for simple text, but if those `<li>` elements held internal state (e.g., an input field's value) or complex child components, their state would be completely messed up.\n\n**The Fix: Use a stable, unique identifier for each item.**\n\nIf your data items have unique IDs from your backend, use those.\n\n```typescript\ninterface Item {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n}\n\nfunction ItemList({ items }: { items: Item[] }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map((item) => (\n        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li> // Much better!\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Insight:** `key` props help React efficiently identify, reorder, and reconcile elements in a list. They are not about performance in isolation, but about maintaining the *identity* of each list item across renders.\n\n### Wrapping Up\n\nMy journey through React's early challenges taught me that mastering a framework isn't just about syntax; it's about internalizing its core principles. These \"mistakes\" weren't just errors in my code; they were opportunities to dive deeper into React's philosophy \u2013 its declarative nature, its one-way data flow, and its emphasis on component-based architecture.\n\nDon't be afraid to make these mistakes; they're an inevitable part of the learning process. What matters is taking the time to understand *why* something broke, rather than just patching it. Read the docs, experiment, and don't hesitate to ask questions. Every \"bug\" is just a puzzle waiting to be solved, leading you closer to becoming a more intuitive and effective React developer. Happy coding!",
  "tweets": "1/7 First diving into React, I genuinely thought I could just slap `setState` anywhere and things would magically align. Oh, the chaos! My early \"components\" were just functions trying to be imperative DOM manipulators. #ReactJS #WebDev\n\n2/7 The `useEffect` hook felt like a superpower until I hit my first infinite loop. Realized it's not `componentDidMount`++. It's about *synchronizing* side effects with dependencies. Missing `[]` or wrong deps? Pain. Your linter is your friend. #ReactHooks\n\n3/7 Prop drilling is a sneaky beast. Starts innocent, then suddenly you're passing a `theme` prop through 5 layers of components that don't even use it. Recognize it early. React Context isn't always the answer, but it's a start. #FrontendDev\n\n4/7 Keys in lists: Don't use `index` as a `key` if your list items can change order or be added/removed. Please. It causes weird bugs and destroys component state. Give your items stable, unique IDs. Your users (and debug session) will thank you. #ReactTips\n\n5/7 My biggest \"aha!\" moment: React isn't about changing the DOM. It's about *describing* the UI for a given state, then letting React figure out the diff. Embrace the declarative mindset; stop fighting the render cycle. #JavaScript\n\n6/7 Building monolithic \"god components\" was another early trap. Break things down. Smaller, focused components are easier to reason about, test, and reuse. Component composition over massive files, always. #CleanCode\n\n7/7 The learning curve for React is real, but every \"mistake\" is a deeper dive into understanding. Don't just fix the bug, understand *why* it was a bug. What core React principle did you miss? That's where the real growth happens. What was *your* biggest early React mistake? #DeveloperJourney"
